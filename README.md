# MediFlow â€“ Hospital Management System

## Overview
MediFlow is a **Spring Boot learning project** developed to explore and practice advanced Spring Boot concepts in a real-world context.  
The application simulates a hospital management system, handling patients, doctors, appointments, and treatments.

It demonstrates **key Spring Boot features** such as:  
- Transactional management with rollback and propagation  
- JPA lifecycle callbacks and auditing  
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for logging and performance monitoring  
- Domain events and event-driven architecture  
- Dynamic querying with Specification / Querydsl  
- Modular design patterns (Observer, Strategy, Template Method, Factory)  

This project is intended to **practice and showcase professional-level Spring Boot skills** while being a learning-focused application.
